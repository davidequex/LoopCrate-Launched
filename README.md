# LoopCrate-Launched

LoopCrate started as a small idea — a cleaner way to share my loop and sample packs without relying on Google Drive links. What began as something simple for my own music quickly turned into a full platform where producers can upload, browse, and download loops from each other in one place.

The goal with LoopCrate has always been about accessibility and community. I wanted a space that felt built for producers — no clutter, no paywalls, just good sounds and people who love making music. On the site, you can preview loops, search by vibe or instrument, and instantly download what catches your ear.

Throughout this GitHub, I’ve been documenting the process of building LoopCrate from scratch — from setting up Firebase authentication and storage, to designing the UI and adding user uploads. It’s been a mix of web development, design, and problem-solving, but the end goal has stayed the same: build something that helps creators share what they make.

LoopCrate is now live and running, and I’ll keep updating it as I improve the site and add new features. You can check it out at https://loopcrate.netlify.app/
